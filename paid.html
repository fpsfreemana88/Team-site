    <h1> Who is the highest paid Lions player ever?</h1>
<img src="Paid-players.html">
    <h3> How is salary determined from player to player? </h3>
    <p> Salary is based on how much the player wants, skill the player has, how much the player needs, and the skills the player has. </p>
    <h3> How does pay change from player to player?</h3>
    <p> Pay changes based on everything stated before. If a team needs a quarterback, quarterbacks may receive higher pay from that team. But skill could either drive a salary up or down. The more a team likes your skills, the more they are willing to pay a player. If one team believes that a player is costing too much, they can trade a player for another.</p>
    <h3> Jared Goff</h3>
    <p> Jared Goff is the highest paid player to play for the Detroit Lions. He is a very skilled quarterback who led the Lions to back-to-back playoffs.<p/>
    <h3> Matthew Stafford</h3>
